## Overview
Proprioception is essential for perception and action. Like any other sense, proprioception is also subject to illusions. In this research, we model classic proprioceptive illusions in which tendon vibrations lead to biases in estimating the state of the body.

We investigate these illusions with task-driven models that have been trained to infer the state of the body from distributed sensory muscle spindle inputs (primary and secondary afferents). Recent work has shown that such models exhibit representations similar to the neural code along the ascending proprioceptive pathway.

Importantly, we did not train the models on illusion experiments and simulated muscle-tendon vibrations by considering their effect on primary afferents. Our results demonstrate that task-driven models are indeed susceptible to proprioceptive illusions, with the magnitude of the illusion depending on the vibration frequency. This work illustrates that primary afferents alone are sufficient to account for these classic illusions and provides a foundation for future theory-driven experiments.

The preprint is available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.15.643457v1).

## Contributions

1. **Simulating Proprioceptive Illusions**: We modeled how tendon vibrations affect afferent signals and demonstrated that these altered inputs lead to illusory perceptions in deep learning models.

2. **Frequency-Dependent Illusion Profiles**: We showed that the strength of the illusion varies with vibration frequency, matching patterns observed in human psychophysics experiments.

3. **Role of Afferent Types**: Our research highlights distinct contributions of primary (type Ia) and secondary (type II) afferents to proprioceptive illusions.

4. **Muscle-Specific Effects**: We systematically investigated the effects of vibrating each of the 25 modeled muscles, revealing functional relationships between specific muscles and elbow angle perception.

5. **Mechanism Insights**: We established a direct link between peripheral physiological properties of muscle spindles and central perceptual illusions.
